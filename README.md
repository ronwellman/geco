# GECO
This is a repository for various GECO girls projects.

## Projects
1. [rpi_poll.py](./rpi_poll.py)
   This script is used to poll the GECO Girls D-Link DGL-4500 for the IP addresses of the Raspberry PIs (RPi). 

2. [RPi.tex](./doc/RPi.tex)
   This LATEX document was using in generating a how-to for setting up ssh and VNC on a Raspberry Pi.  It then shows how to install Real-VNC on a Windows, OSX, and Linux box to connect to the RPI.  This was written and compiled with TeXstudio and based off of a template from [http://www.LaTeXTemplates.com](http://www.LaTeXTemplates.com).

3. [Morse Code](./morse_code/)
    This Raspberry Pi project involves using a python script to generate Morse code to a buzzer connected to it.

4. [Binary Display](./binary_display/)
    This Raspberry Pi project involves combining LEDs and a python script to convert a number to Binary and light up the corresponding LEDs.

5. [Calculator](./calculator/)
    This Raspberry Pi project extends the Binary display with the addition of five push buttons to build a calculator capable of adding two 4-bit numbers and displaying them to the LEDs.

6. [Message Board](./message_board/)
    This project is a very small project that builds a socket between from client to server for posting  messages.

7. [Analog Sensors](./analog_sensors/)
    This project utilizes the MCP3002 Analog to Digital Converter (ADC) to read from a temperature and light sensor.
