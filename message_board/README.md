# Message Board
In this lab, we are building a client to interact with a server via a network
socket.  It is a very short and sweet lab to demonstrate networking concepts.
This can be completed with a Raspberry Pi or any system running Python.

This lab should be completed after going through the [Networking
Primer](./Networking_Primer.pdf) PDF.  The document takes roughly 30-45 minutes
to get through and the lab should take about 15-20 minutes.  To allow for
questions, discussions, and troubleshooting, 1.5 hours is a good timeline to
shoot for.
