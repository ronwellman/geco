# Geco Girls Morse Code Generator
This small program is used to demonstrate the use of **if** statements, **for
loops**, and **exceptions** for the Geco Girls coding club.  Additionally, we talk about the circuit
(transister, resister, and buzzer) attached to the Raspberry PI via GPIO 17.

## Hardware
All of the below parts are part of the Sunfounder Super Kit v2 for Raspberry Pi
(RPi) except for the RPi itself. The hardware follows Lab 6 in the manual that
comes with the kit.

  * RPi
  * Breadboard
  * 1k Resister
  * Buzzer
  * PNP Transister (8550)
  * ~ 6 Jumper wires

## Software
With the exception of this project's files, no other software is required
outside of the standard Raspian image for the RPi.  generator.py was written 
by Joshua Wellman and morse_code.py was copied from Geeks for Geeks.  See
